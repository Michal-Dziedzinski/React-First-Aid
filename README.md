# Welcome to Grabber App!

The grabber application was created as our idea during the **HackYeah 2019** Hackathon. You can read more about the task we undertook [here](https://hackyeah.pl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PMI-zadanie-szczegolowe.pdf)

## What is the idea for the application?

You can read more about our application in the presentation we have prepared [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X7DognJLUNI5g0sQ2Xv_ekAPcIa4FYbB/view?usp=sharing)

In [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_lRWjeKik6ncd8hXdWeJf0LplpyEv5gA/view?usp=sharing) video you can see how John, Katie and all other people can benefit from using the Grabber app:

## How can I check the idea?
